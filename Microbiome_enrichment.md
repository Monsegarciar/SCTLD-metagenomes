## Microbiome enrichment protocol
This is the adapted protocol for the New England Biolabs Microbiome Enrichment kit, specifically for Coral DNA:

Reagents expressed in **bold** need a calculation from this document.

### Prepare beads

1.Resuspend NEBNext Protein A Magnetic Beads by gently pipetting the slurry up and down until the suspension is homogeneous. Alternatively, rotate the tube on a rotating mixer gently for 15 minutes at 4°C. Do not vortex.

2.Prepare 1X Bind/wash Buffer on ice by diluting 1 part NEBNext Bind/wash Buffer (5X) with 4 parts DNase-free water. Determine how much **buffer** is needed.

3.In one tube, add X μl of **MBD2-Fc protein** and **Y μl of Protein A Magnetic Beads**. Mix by pipetting up and down until the beads are completely homogeneous, at least 5-10 times.

4.Mix the bead-protein mixture by placing the tube in a rotating mixer for 10 minutes at room temperature.

5.Briefly spin the tube and place on the magnetic rack for 2–5 minutes or until the beads have collected to the wall of the tube and the solution is clear.

6.Carefully remove the supernatant with a pipette without disturbing the beads.

7.Add 1 ml of 1X Bind/wash Buffer (kept on ice) to the tube to wash the beads. Pipette up and down until the beads are completely homogeneous, at least 5-10 times.

8.Mix the beads on a rotating mixer for 3 minutes at room temperature.

9.Briefly spin the tube and place on the magnetic rack for 2–5 minutes or until the beads have collected to the wall of the tube and the solution is clear.

10.Carefully remove the supernatant with a pipette without disturbing the beads.

11.Repeat steps 7–10.

12.Remove the tube from the rack and add 160 μl of 1X Bind/wash Buffer (kept on ice) to resuspend the beads. For input amounts other than 1 μg, add (Y) μl of **1X Bind/wash Buffer** to resuspend the beads. Mix by pipetting up and down a few times.

13.The MBD2-Fc-bound magnetic beads are stable for up to 7 days at 4°C

### Capture Methylated Host DNA
1.Add 1 μg in up to 200 μl input DNA to the tube containing the Z μl of **MBD2-Fc-bound magnetic beads**. For other DNA input amounts, add DNA to (Y) μl of **MBD2-Fc bound magnetic beads**.

2.Add **undiluted Bind/wash Buffer** (5X) for a final concentration of 1X. Pipette the sample up and down until the beads are completely homogenous, at least 5-10 times. 

3.Agitate the tube on a rotating mixer for 15 minutes at room temperature with rotation.
 
### Collect Enriched Microbial DNA
1.Briefly spin the tube and place on the magnetic rack for 5 minutes until the beads have collected to the wall of the tube and the solution is clear.

2.Carefully remove the supernatant with a pipette, without disturbing the beads and transfer it to a clean microcentrifuge tube. This supernatant contains the target microbial DNA. Store this sample at –20°C or proceed directly to purification: 
### Agencourt® AMPure® XP Cleanup
1.Vortex AMPure XPto resuspend.

2.If your enriched sample volume x 2.8 from the previous step exceeds your tube volume, split into two tubes.

3.Add 1.8X volume of resuspended **AMPure XP** to the sample. Mix well by pipetting up and down at least 10 times. Be careful to expel all of the liquid out of the tip during the last mix.

4.Incubate samples for at least 5 minutes at room temperature.

5.Place the tube on the appropriate magnetic stand to separate the beads from the supernatant. If necessary, quickly spin the sample to collect the liquid from the sides of the tube or plate wells before placing on the magnetic stand.

6.After 5 minutes (or when the solution is clear), carefully remove and discard the supernatant. Be careful not to disturb the beads that contain DNA targets.

7.Add 400 μl of freshly prepared 80% ethanol to the tube/plate while in the magnetic stand. Incubate at room temperature for 30 seconds, and then carefully remove and discard the supernatant. Be careful not to disturb the beads that contain DNA targets.

8.Repeat Step 7 once for a total of two washes. Be sure to remove all visible liquid after the second wash. If necessary, briefly spin the tube/plate, place back on the magnetic stand and remove traces of ethanol with a p10 pipette tip.

9.Air dry the beads for up to 5 minutes while the tube/plate is on the magnetic stand with the lid open.

*Caution: Do not over-dry the beads. This may result in lower recovery of DNA. Elute the samples when the beads are still dark brown and glossy looking, but when all visible liquid has evaporated. When the beads turn brown and start to crack, they are too dry.* 

10.Remove the tube from the magnetic stand. Elute the DNA target from the beads by adding 50 μl of 1X TE (use 25 μl for each tube if sample was split in two).

11.Mix well by pipetting up and down 10 times. Incubate for at least 2 minutes at room temperature. If necessary, quickly spin the sample to collect the liquid from the sides of the tube or plate wells before placing back on the magnetic stand.

12.Place the tube/plate on the magnetic stand. After 5 minutes (or when the solution is clear), transfer eluate to a new microcentrifuge tube (combine the eluates if sample was split in two).
