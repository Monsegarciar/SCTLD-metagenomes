    "#### MetaBat2\n",
    "The first piece of code here generates a fairly simple text file for the coverage of these files. The next set of code runs MetaBat2  (v2.10.2) using minContig 1500, minCV 1.0, minCVSum 1.0, maxP 95%, minS 60, lcuster size 50000 and maxEdges 200. It sets the minimum size for a bin to 200000 basepairs, which is fairly low, so you can keep it. It gathers all mapping information into a single depth file, so you can use your 1 file in the next analysis. An important parameter to play around with is the minimum bin size. When set to 200000, this will severely limit the amount of bins you gain, especially if your samples aren't perfect. Therefore, it is wise to run MetaBAT several times with slight alterations to the -s flag to find your optimal setting (you don't want 3 bins, you also don't want 1000).\n",
