This is due to the fact that most binning softwares rely on the use of k-mers, and smaller sizes don't give an accurate k-mer signature for k-step =4. So, the following piece of code uses scripts from Anvi'O to do two things: fix the deflines of your contigs, so Anvi'O can use them (and makes them nice and uniform), and *remove* all contigs that are under 1000 bp. It is strongly recommended to save your contigs, so you can be sure to go back to them if you decide to go another direction with this. "
