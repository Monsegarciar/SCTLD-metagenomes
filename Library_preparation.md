# Library preparation for enriched coral microbiome DNA
This protocol has been adapted from the NEB protocol for Illumina NGS library preparation:

The protocol consists of 5 steps. Safe stopping points will be **indicated**. 

### Fragmentation

### Adaptor ligation

### Clean-up reaction 1 (probably change this)
1. Vortex AmPure XP Purification Beads to resuspend.
 
2. Add 57 μl (0.8X) resuspended beads to the PCR reaction. Mix well by pipetting up and down at least 10 times. Be careful to expel all of the liquid out of the tip during the last mix. Vortexing for 3-5 seconds on high can also be used. If centrifuging samples after mixing, be sure to stop the centrifugation before the beads start to settle out.
 
3. Incubate samples on bench top for at least 5 minutes at room temperature.
 
4. Place the tube/plate on an appropriate magnetic stand to separate the beads from the supernatant. If necessary, quickly spin the sample to collect the liquid from the sides of the tube or plate wells before placing on the magnetic stand.

5. After 5 minutes (or when the solution is clear), carefully remove and discard the supernatant. Be careful not to disturb the beads that contain DNA targets(Caution: do not discard the beads).

6. Add 200 μl of 80% freshly prepared ethanol to the tube/plate while in the magnetic stand. Incubate at room temperature for 30 seconds, and then carefully remove and discard the supernatant. Be careful not to disturb the beads that contain DNA targets.

7. Repeat Step 1.5.6. once for a total of two washes. Be sure to remove all visible liquid after the second wash. If necessary, briefly spin the tube/plate, place back on the magnet and remove traces of ethanol with a p10 pipette tip.

8. Air dry the beads for up to 5 minutes while the tube/plate is on the magnetic stand with the lid open.

**Caution:** Do not over-dry the beads. This may result in lower recovery of DNA. Elute the samples when the beads are still dark brown and glossy looking, but when all visible liquid has evaporated. When the beads turn lighter brown and start to crack they are too dry.

9. Remove the tube/plate from the magnetic stand. Elute the DNA target from the beads by adding 33 μl of 0.1X TE (dilute 1X TE Buffer 1:10 in water).

10. Mix well by pipetting up and down 10 times, or on a vortex mixer. Incubate for at least 2 minutes at room temperature. If necessary, quickly spin the sample to collect the liquid from the sides of the tube or plate wells before placing back on the magnetic stand.

11. Place the tube/plate on the magnetic stand. After 5 minutes (or when the solution is clear), transfer 30 μl to a new PCR tube.

**Samples can be stored overnight at -20°C. ** 

### PCR amplification of library

### Post-PCR cleanup

1. Vortex AmPure XP Purification Beads to resuspend.
 
2. Add 45 μl (0.9X) resuspended beads to the PCR reaction. Mix well by pipetting up and down at least 10 times. Be careful to expel all of the liquid out of the tip during the last mix. Vortexing for 3-5 seconds on high can also be used. If centrifuging samples after mixing, be sure to stop the centrifugation before the beads start to settle out.
